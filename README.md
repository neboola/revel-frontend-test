You will receive an invitation to the design you have to code.

Using the play button on the header menu in figma you can check how the screen should look and using the inspect mode you'll be able to find about the implementation details (margins, font sizes, etc).
On the figma's aside you can change to desktop,  mobile and components screens.

The idea is to show a random set of 9 images per load using a fanstastic free-to-use API called Lorem Picsum: https://picsum.photos/

1. Read the docs and discover Lorem Picsum's API.
2. Connect the API to your frontend code.
  - Use the list endpoint to get a list of 100 elements.
  - Show those images in the list and display the author's name on the card as showed in the design.
3. The app has to have some filters: 
	- An input that filter by author
	- Some buttons to change the blur and the grayscale. If one of these is on, the 		other has to be desactivate.
4. The picture at the hero has to be created manual, with css (not to export the image with figma).
5. The header changes on scroll (the diferences between scolled and not scrolled are in the section 'main-header').



Feel free to use any client side JS framework/library but we recommend you to use React or Nextjs.

Focus on  **pixel perfect**, **performance** and **readability**. Consider any corner cases.

Write down any assumption you make.

You can share your code with us using a github repository or a google drive link. You can even deploy they project using something like github pages if you want.

Happy coding ü§ì
