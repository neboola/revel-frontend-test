You will receive an invitation to the Figma design that you have to code. You need to sign in to use the inspect mode (it's free). Watch [this screencast](https://www.loom.com/share/5c00e045dd5a465da9005191b5f86683) if you need help.

Using the inspect mode you'll be able to find about the implementation details (margins, font sizes, etc).

On the left side menu aside you can change between desktop, mobile and components screens.


## About the tesst

The idea is to show a responsive grid with a set of 9 images per load using a fanstastic free-to-use API called Lorem Picsum: https://picsum.photos/

1. Read the docs and discover Lorem Picsum's API.
2. Connect the API to your frontend code.
  - Use the list endpoint to get a list of 9 elements.
  - Show the images in the grid and display the author's name on the card as showed in the design (hover in Desktop, below the card in mobile)
  - If load more is clicked, a new set of 9 images should be appended.
  - The number on the top right of the card is always incremental (01,02,03...)
3. The filter box needs to filter the grid by author as you type.
 
Focus on  **pixel perfect**, **performance** and **readability**. Consider **any corner cases**.

Some of the aspects we will have in mind while reviewing:
- Code structure
- Error handling
- Attention to detail
- General good code practises.
- Use of the latest features in React (i.e. hooks)

**We strongly recommend using React.js or React + Next.js.**

Write down any assumption you make.

You can share your code with us using a github repository, a google drive link or an email attachment. You can even deploy they project using something like github pages if you want.

Happy coding ü§ì
